The JaDom environemtn is built with the flexibilty to usevarious framworks of your choosing. By default, the environment isset up to allow for minimal front end UI development. This i saccomplished by the generateing the html code from the JaDom java classes. Te current setup also makes heavy use of the FileHelper classs to read static text like this into the domelements.
You can also use JaDom with JSP,s. The Prebuilt servet classes set up your environment for easy cusomtization and access to data from fromt to back.
The base of the JaDom framwork relys heavile on the DOMelement class. This class is a Java representation of a basic Dom element. Almost all the JaDom elements extends the abstract DOMeleement class. While some classes have more properties then others, all the JaDom elements that extend the abstact DOMeleemnt class have the ablilty to act in ways that help better bridge the gap between Web deleopement and JavaDeveleopime.


The purpose of the JaDom expermenit is to look at developing a framwork that bettter delivers web applications from a single source. JaDom is an attept to combine the powerful computaiton of Java with the capabilities of the web DOM. JaDom will allow developers to go straight from back end developent to UI, all in Java.
