COMPLETLY DISABLE BOOTSTRAP

to completely remove bootstrap, simply remove the boot srtap include in the Top.jsp file.  
You can also remove the boot strap refrecing line in the Bottome.jsp, however keep in mind this does
install jQuery so you may have to include the jquery jsp if you have additional jQuery on your page.
